# ðŸŽ¼ Modusica - Modular Extension Host Framework  
  
> **Modusica** is an experimental, modular framework that started as a music player and has evolved into a powerful platform for building extensible applications.    
> The goal is to create a flexible **host environment** where all features are modular, each provided by independently developed extensions. This architecture allows for a broad range of applications, from media players to complex development environments.  
  
## ðŸ”¥ Key Features  
  
- **Modular Design**: All features are driven by extensions, allowing users to dynamically add and modify functionality.  
- **Message-driven Architecture**: Uses **Command / Query / Event** patterns for communication between components.  
- **UIItemTree**: A virtual UI structure that decouples UI from the core, enabling flexible interface management by extensions.  
- **High Performance**: Extensions communicate efficiently via **NamedPipe** and **MessagePack/JSON**.  
- **Undo and Command History**: Supports undoable actions and tracks all modifications with a history log.  
- **Secure Extension System**: Extensions cannot directly modify core state but must request permission via safe commands.  
  
## ðŸš€ Project Status  
  
This project is **under active development** and is focused on making the architecture more flexible and extensible.  
  
Key areas in development:  
- Refining extension lifecycle and message passing  
- Creating a minimal shell UI extension  
- Improving performance for multiple extensions  
- Documentation for extension developers  
  
## ðŸ’¡ Why Modusica?  
  
- **For developers who want a flexible framework**: Modusica is built for flexibility, allowing you to easily integrate new features and control their behavior via simple extensions.  
- **For modular, customizable apps**: Whether you're building a media player, tool, or any other type of application, Modusica provides the foundation to get started with a fully extensible architecture.
