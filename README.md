# Modusica

**Modusica** is a private project currently under development.  
Its aim is to build a highly modular, extension-driven application framework—  
originally inspired by the idea of a flexible, controllable music player.

This repository exists to preserve the **name** and **core concept** of the project.

## Concept Summary

Modusica is designed as a **lightweight host application** where every feature, including the UI, is provided by extensions.  
It follows a message-based architecture using **Command / Query / Event** patterns,  
and emphasizes full **runtime flexibility**, **extensibility**, and **modular structure**.
